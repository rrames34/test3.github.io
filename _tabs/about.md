I am Rajesh Ramesh (First name: Rajesh, Last name: Ramesh), from India.

I am an active user of open-source CFD software like Nek (Nek5000,NekRS) and OpenFOAM. I was introduced to Nek during my PhD research at Arizona State University (ASU). What I like about Nek is the scalability to run very large simulations provided you have access to supercomputers with 100s of GPUs and 1000s of CPUs. The idea of open-source is to build on top of it any additonal modules. At the heart of most engineering problems, it’s the Navier Stokes equations that you are solving for and Nek allows you to add additonal physics into your solver by solving additional transport equations or modeling source terms to include.. For my PhD, I am using Nek5000 to simulate problems relevant in geophysics like dust devils and dust entrainment mechanisms.
