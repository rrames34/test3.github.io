I am Rajesh Ramesh (First name: Rajesh, Last name: Ramesh), from India.

I am an active user of open-source CFD software like Nek (Nek5000,NekRS) and OpenFOAM. I was introduced to Nek during my PhD research at Arizona State University (ASU). What I like about Nek is its scalability to run large-scale simulations provided you have access to supercomputers with with 100s of GPUs and 1000s of CPUs. The idea of open-source code is the freedom to build on top of it any additonal modules specific to your problem. At the heart of most engineering fluid flow problems, it’s the Navier Stokes (N-S) equations that you are solving for and Nek allows you to add additonal physics into your solver by solving additional transport equations and/or modeling source terms in N-S equations. For my PhD, I am using Nek5000 to simulate problems relevant in geophysics like dust devils and dust entrainment mechanisms.
